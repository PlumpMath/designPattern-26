Creational Patterns - Abstract Factory Pattern
==============================================

  This pattern is one level is abstraction higher than factory pattern. This means that
  the abstract factory returns the factory of classes. Like factory pattern returned one
  of the several sub-classes, this returns such factory which lattern will return one
  of the sub-classes.
  
When to use Abstract Factory Pattern?

  One of the main advantages of Abstract Factory Pattern is that it isolates the 
  concrete classes that are generated. The names of actual implementing classes are 
  not needed to be known at the client side. Because of the isolation, you can change 
  the implementation from one factory to another.
