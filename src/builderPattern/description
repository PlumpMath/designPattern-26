Where we can apply this pattern:
================================

	This is common to all the fast-food restaurants and all the children meals. Here everytime the childrens 
	meals is ordered, the service boy will take a burger, a fries , cold drink and a toy. Now suppose, there 
	are 3 types of burgers available. Veg, Fish, Chicken, 2 types of cold drinks available and 2 types of toys 
	are available.
	
	So the order might be a combination of one of these, but the process will be the same. One burger, one 
	cold drink, one fries and one toy. All these items are placed in paper and given to the customer.
